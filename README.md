#Socket Chat - Client/Server Network Programming Application in C language

## Description

This project involves developing a client-server application using socket programming. The application allows clients to connect to a server and communicate with each other in real-time.

The server acts as a central hub, receiving messages from clients and broadcasting them to all connected clients. Clients can send messages to the server, which will then distribute them to other connected clients. The communication will be bidirectional, allowing clients to both send and receive messages.

The project is implemented in C and follows the client-server model, with the server running on a specific host and port, and clients connecting to the server using their IP address and port number.
